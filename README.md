# the Machine Learning Repertoire Framework wiki

# This GitHub serves as a companion to the paper: "A computational framework to characterize and compare the vocal repertoires of toothed whales"


Toothed whales are among the most acoustically specialized vertebrates, but their vocal repertoires have not been thoroughly characterized in comparison to other species like songbirds and primates. Current descriptions of their vocalizations often lack standardization, making it challenging to compare across species and populations, which is critical for understanding the evolutionary, social, and environmental drivers of vocal repertoire development.

In this study, we reviewed and compared six bioacoustic software packages, many of which employ machine learning for the detection, extraction, and categorization of acoustic contours:
Luscinia
Beluga
ARTwarp
DeepSqueak
PAMGuard
SASLab

We applied these tools to recordings from four dolphin species to establish a set of guidelines, recommendations, and scripts for replicating the analyses and improving repertoire characterizations.

This GitHub contains all scripts and data that were used for the paper, as well as a detailed wiki with program guides and troubleshooting.
