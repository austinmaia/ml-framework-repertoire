# ml-framework-repertoire

# This github has been made to accompany Austin et al., 2024 ("A computational framework to characterize and compare the acoustic repertoires of toothed whales"). Included are the protocols for sound selection, signal extraction, and analysis across each program, as well as the extracted contours used in the paper and the code to generate the figures.
